2. Librarian
• The one who manages the book catalogue and book loans.
3. System Administrator (Staff)
• Manages the library member and librarian accounts.

The application must be developed using python programming language. Data must be stored 
in text files. The program submitted should be free of syntax and runtime errors. Besides that, 
validation should be done for each entry from the users to avoid logical errors.

# REQUIREMENTS
i. You are required to carry out extra research for your system and document for any 
logical assumptions you made after the research. 
ii. Your program should use symbolic constants where appropriate. Validations need 
to be included to ensure the accuracy of the system. State any assumptions that you 
make under each function. 
iii. You are required to store all data in text files. There is no limit on the number of 
text files that can be used but think of efficiency as well since too many text files 
also can affect the system performance.
iv. You are expected to use any type of data storing and functions in your program. 
Your program must embrace modular programming technique and should be menu 
driven.
v. You may include any extra features which you may feel relevant and that add value 
to the system. 
vi. There should be no need for graphics in your program, as what is being assessed, is 
your programming skill not the interface design. The marking scheme for the 
assignment has been provided so that you clearly know how the assessment for this 
assignment would be done.
vii. You should include the good programming practice such as comments, variable 
naming conventions and indentation.
